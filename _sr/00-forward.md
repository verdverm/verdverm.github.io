This is the online form of my dissertation,
the subject of which is Symbolic Regression.

It is a work in progress with completion
planned for by the end of November 2015.

Cheers,
Tony

I've included the following 
two quotes from prior publications
in the hope that it will frame this work in the 
larger context of producing usable SR tools and technologies.
Much of the research in SR aims at improving
the GP implementation, with only limited results and inconsistent comparisons.
By reconsidering the definition of the SR problem,
we believe that PGE is an evolution in perspective and approach.
Through determinism 
we may further our understanding of the problem
and find ways 
to create such a true Symbolic Regression technology.

Genetic programming (GP) is not a field noted for the rigor
of its benchmarking. Some of its benchmark problems are
popular purely through historical contingency, and they can
be criticized as too easy or as providing misleading information 
concerning real-world performance, but they persist
largely because of inertia and the lack of good alternatives.
Even where the problems themselves are impeccable, comparisons 
between studies are made more difficult by the lack
of standardization. We argue that the definition of standard
benchmarks is an essential step in the maturation of the
field. We make several contributions towards this goal. We
motivate the development of a benchmark suite and define
its goals; we survey existing practice; we enumerate many
candidate benchmarks; we report progress on reference 
implementations; and we set out a concrete plan for gathering
feedback from the GP community that would, if adopted,
lead to a standard set of benchmarks.

<blockquote>
	
Outside the GP literature, SR is rare; there are only scattered references such
as (Langley et al., 1987). In contrast, the GP literature has dozens of papers on
SR every year; even the previous GPTP had seven papers involving SR (Riolo
et al., 2010). In a sense, the home field of SR is GP. This means, of course,
that when authors aim at SR, they start with GP, and look to modify GP to
improve speed, scalability, reliability, interpretability, etc. The improvements
are typically 2x to 10x, but fall short of performance that would makes SR a
“technology” the way LS or linear programming is.
We are aiming for SR as a technology. What if we did not constrain ourselves
to using GP? To GP researchers, this may seem heretical at first glance. But if
the aim is truly to improve SR, then this should pose no issue. And in fact, we
argue that the GP literature is still an appropriate home for such work, because
(a) GP authors doing SR deeply care about SR problems, and (b) as already
mentioned, GP is where all the SR publications are. Of course, we can draw
inspiration from GP literature, but also many other potentially-useful fields.
